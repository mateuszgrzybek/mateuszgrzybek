- 👋 Hi, I’m @mateuszgrzybek, a front-end developer
- 👀 I’m interested in both front-end and back-end related technologies such as TypeScript, Vue, Pinia, Vuex, .NET ecosystem, Python, as well as test-automation tools such as Selenium, Cucumber/Gherkin and Specflow
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Vue3 combined with Pinia, Yup and Vee-Validate, and familiarising myself with Vite.
